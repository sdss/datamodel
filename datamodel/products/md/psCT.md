## Basic Information
Photometric calibrations as a function of time.  There is one time-stamped
photometric calibration for every calibration patch intersected by the run
for which processed MT data exists.  The time-stamp indicates the time at
which the calibration patch was observed by the Imaging Camera during this
run.

### Naming Convention
psCT-rrrrrr-c.fit,
where <i>rrrrrr</i> is the imaging run number and <i>c</i> is the column
location in the Imaging Array of the CCD which acquired the data (1-6).

### HDU1: 
There is one HDU of this format per file.  There is only one entry for each
calibration patch intersected by the run for which processed MT data exists.
The order of the filters in each row is the same as the order of filters in
the PDU keyword <i>FILTER</i>.

## Basic Information
Targets in the area around a particular field and their assignments within this field. Each entry is an entry from the carton_to_target table in targetdb and has a unique RSID. Different RSIDs can correspond to the same CATALOGID (and thus actually be the same object), but may have different desired cadence or spectrograph requirements. Produced by the robostrategy script rs_assign_final, using the tofits() method of the Field class. Can be read in by fromfits() method of the Field class. This file is the version to be loaded into targetdb.

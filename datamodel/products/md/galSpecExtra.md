## Basic Information
Physical parameter measurements for
fibers for which the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has
been run.  This file is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN
product. It is designed to be line-by-line matched with the <a href="specObj.html"> specObj</a> list of all spectra. Any
spectra in specObj that do not have a measurement from the MPA-JHU
pipeline have all values zeroed out in this file. There is further
information about the MPA-JHU results in the parallel files <a href="galSpecInfo.html"> galSpecInfo</a> , <a href="galSpecLine.html">
galSpecLine</a> , and <a href="galSpecIndx.html"> galSpecIndx</a> . ID
values in <a href="galSpecInfo.html"> galSpecInfo</a> are set to -1
for cases where there were no results from the MPA-JHU pipeline. In
some cases, the pipeline was run but we don't believe the results are
reliable, in which case the column "RELIABLE" in <a href="galSpecInfo.html">galSpecInfo</a> is set to zero.

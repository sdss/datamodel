## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
For IDL users, the idlutils utility "read_fits_polygons" can be used to
read in this file into a format that the other idlutils mangle
utilities (e.g. plot_poly or is_in_window) can read. It can be output
as a standard ASCII mangle file with "read_mangle_polygons".

Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | XCAPS | float64[27] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | direction on unit sphere of each cap

## Basic Information
Contains matches of the SDSS imaging data to the 2MASS Point Source
Catalog, for a single field. Identification information for the SDSS
source is given, along with all of the 2MASS information. See <a href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/tmc.format.html"> the
official 2MASS documentation</a> for detailed documentation of the
2MASS formats. These matches are to any objects which
are RUN_PRIMARY according to the local resolve (see <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/algorithms/resolve/">resolve
documentation</a> ).

 | TMASS_CC_FLG | char[3] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Contamination and confusion flag. Three character flag, one character per band [JHKs], that indicates that the photometry and/or position measurements of a source may be contaminated or biased due to proximity to an image artifact or nearby source of equal or greater brightness. (See 2MASS PSC documentation). |

source was detected in each band |

source was within the boundaries of in  each band |
 | TMASS_GAL_CONTAM | bool | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Extended source "contamination" flag. A value of gal_contam="0" indicates no contamination. "1" indicates it is probably an extended source itself (this does not detect all such cases!).  "2" indicates it is within the boundary of a large XSC source. (See 2MASS PSC documentation). |
 | TMASS_MP_FLG | bool | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Minor planet flag. "1" if source associated with known solar system object, "0" otherwise. (See 2MASS PSC documentation). |
 | TMASS_PTS_KEY | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Unique identification number for the PSC source. |
 | TMASS_HEMIS | char | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Hemisphere code for the 2MASS Observatory from which this source was observed.  "n" means North (Mt. Hopkins); "s" means South (CTIO). |
 | TMASS_JDATE | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Julian Date of the source measurement accurate to +30 seconds. (See 2MASS PSC documentation). |
 | TMASS_DUP_SRC | bool | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Duplicate source flag. Used in conjunction with the use_src flag, this numerical flag indicates whether the source falls in a Tile overlap region, and if so, if it was detected multiple times. (See 2MASS PSC documentation) |
 | TMASS_USE_SRC | bool | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Use source flag. Used in conjunction with the dup_src flag, this numerical flag indicates if a source falls within a Tile overlap region, and whether or not it satisfies the unbiased selection rules for multiple source resolution. (See 2MASS PSC documentation). |

## Basic Information
This file contains the information
about the targeting in the SDSS DR7 Legacy survey. It contains various
status bits derived from tsField files pulled out of the final opdb
from SDSS-II. Additionally, we have determined the versions of target
and photo used for each field.  Finally, the geometry of each field
that was used for targeting is included. The geometrical information
describing the area of the field used for targeting is in mangle-type
format (see the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle"> mangle
documentation</a> for a full explanation).

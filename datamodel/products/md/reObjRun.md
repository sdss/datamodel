## Basic Information
This file stores the resolve status within the run (the "local"
resolve) for each object in a field. The local resolve only accounts
for the overlaps between fields of the same run and camcol.  Because
it is made for every field and has a row for every object, and is
rarely referenced, it is kept
pretty minimal in size.

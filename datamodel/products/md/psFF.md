## Basic Information
Flat-field vector for a single CCD.  Actually, this is an <i>inverse</i> flat-field vector, meaning that the raw frame must be multiplied (not
divided) by the vector to recover the desired values.  The pixel values are
stored as unsigned integers.
The <i>TSHIFT</i> keyword gives the amount by which each pixel value has
been multiplied; e.g., if <i>TSHIFT</i> = 32, then each pixel value in
the image is 32 times larger than the true value.  This scaling allows us to
calculate precise values while maintaining pure integers.
See the data model page for "psCT" files for a description of the "KALXX_ID"
keywords.

### Naming Convention
psFF-rrrrrr-bc.fit,
where <i>rrrrrr</i> is the imaging run number, <i>b</i> is the filter used
(u, g, r, i, or z), and <i>c</i> is the column location in the Imaging Array
of the CCD which acquired the data (1-6).

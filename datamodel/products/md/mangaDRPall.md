## Basic Information
This is the final summary for the MaNGA Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP). It merges together information taken from mangacore, the repository containing all MaNGA metadata, and various header information taken from the output MaNGA cubes. It contains no actual spectra from MaNGA cubes, but all of the information required to find a given set of spectra. It can be used to search locally for galaxies matching a given set of selection criteria.

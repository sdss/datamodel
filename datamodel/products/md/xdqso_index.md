## Basic Information
This file provides a spatial index
into the XDQSO results.  Basically, it is a list of all of the SDSS
fields with XDQSO quasars in them, along with the information about
how to access the field.  Thus, you can find a list of fields of
interest using the RA and DEC values, then use the RUN value to find
the appropriate file, which will be an <a href="xdcore/xdcore_RUN6.html">xdcore</a> file. Then IXDCORE is an
index into that file for the first entry in the field, and NXDCORE is
the total number of entries for the field (which are immediately after
the first entry.

## Basic Information
All the SEGUE-1 targeting
information is contained in these files. The files each give the
targets covered by a 1.49 deg radius area; each file is named for a
faint/bright pair of plates covering that area. In general, one is
better off consulting the target files stored within the <a href="/datamodel/files/SSPP_REDUX/targets"> SSPP target directory
tree</a> , unless there appears to be an inconsistency there.

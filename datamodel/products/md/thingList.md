## Basic Information
This file contains the full list of catalog entries for the resolved
survey. Because of the large number of rows, we keep only the minimal
required information for each object. Usually this file is used by
starting with an object's THING_ID, looking up that row in the <a href="thingIndex.html">thingIndex.fits</a> file, and determining the
row(s) of thingList to look at from that. The rows of thingList have
all of the detections of the object you started with. Put another way,
all the detections of the object associated with a certain "thing_id"
can be found in these elements of thingList:
thingList[thingIndex[thing_id].istart:thingIndex[thing_id].istart+thingIndex[thing_id].ndetect-1].

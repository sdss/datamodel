## Basic Information
This file contains the match between balkans and fields in the window
function.  The balkans are the full list of disjoint polygons defined
by the overlap of all of the fields. There is a many-to-many
relationship between the balkans and the fields: each field can be
broken up into many balkans, and each balkan is covered by many
fields. This file contains all matches between balkans and fields,
sorted in order of balkan index.  The corresponding file <a href="window_findx.html">window_findx.fits</a> contains the same
matches but sorted by field index.

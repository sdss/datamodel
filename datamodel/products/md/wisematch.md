## Basic Information
Contains cross-matches between the SDSS photoObj objects and the WISE
All-Sky Release catalog.  Please refer to
the <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec2_2a.html">WISE
catalog explanatory supplement</a> for full details on the WISE
catalog columns.  These files only include a subset of the columns.
<br/>

The astrometric matching was done as follows.  First, the "gal" and
"star" datasweep files were loaded and combined.  Then, a
nearest-neighbor astrometric matching was performed to each of the
WISE "slices" (Dec ranges).  This matching records only the nearest
SDSS object for each WISE object, to a maximum distance of 4
arcseconds.  Once all these matches were finished, the results were
combined by inserting the single-slice matches into a table that is
parallel to the "star" and "gal" datasweep files.  For this reason,
there may be some slight oddities near the WISE "slice" boundaries.
But to first order, each WISE object appears at most once.
<br/>

These files are "parallel" to the datasweep files; row 0 of the
"wisematch" file contains the WISE object matching row 0 of the
"calibObj" datasweep file.  The row will contain null values if there
is no such match; you could check the "sweep_index" column to identify
valid matches: value "-1" indicates no match.

### Naming Convention
<code>wisematch-calibObj-[0-9]{6}-[1-6]-{star,gal}.fits</code>; <code>wisematch-calibObj-RRRRRR-C-{star,gal}.fits</code>
for run RRRRRR and camcol C.

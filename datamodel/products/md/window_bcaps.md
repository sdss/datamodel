## Basic Information
This file contains the full list of caps used in the definition of
the balkans' spherical polygons.
The balkans consist of all the disjoint
spherical
polygons defined by the overlapping fields in the survey. Each
spherical polygon is expressed as the intersection on the sphere of a
number of "caps." See the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle"> mangle documentation</a> for a full explanation. Because of
the vast number of these polygons, the definition of the balkan is split into
two files, this "window_bcaps" file and the corresponding <a href="window_blist.html">window_blist.fits</a> file.

## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
For IDL users, the photoop utility "window_read" can be used to
read in the balkan list. It can also return IDL structures expressing
the balkans, by combining the blist and bcaps files.

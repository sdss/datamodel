## Basic Information
The DAPall file provides final summary tables of the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) results. It provides collated summary information about the DAP methods and global metrics derived from the DAP analysis products useful for sample selection.

Similar to the DRPall file, the DAPall file contains no resolved maps or model spectra, but a set of data that can be useful for selecting subsets of MAPS and model LOGCUBE files for further analysis.

The DAP analyzes each observation (PLATEIFU) once per analysis method (DAPTYPE). However, not all datacubes provided by the DRP are analyzed by the DAP. In DR17, the DAPall file has multiple extensions, one for each DAPTYPE analysis (unlike in previous data releases when all DAPTYPEs were listed in a single extension). There is a row in each extension for all attempted analyses of the available PLATEIFU-DAPTYPE combinations. Some of the attempted analyses faulted, and these are listed among the known issues. The purpose of the DAPDONE column in the DAPall file is to select those PLATEIFU-DAPTYPE combinations where the DAP was successful in its analysis of the data.

For more information see the discussion of MaNGA catalogs in the data-release documentation and the relevant MaNGA DAP ReadTheDocs page.


### Naming Convention

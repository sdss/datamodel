## Basic Information
This table stores the positions used as blank sky regions for DR18 targetting. The sky regions are selected by dividing the sky in tiles of HEALpix nside 32. Each tile is then subdivided in candidate regions of HEALpix nside 32768 and the pixels that meet the isolation requirements are considered valid skies. This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href="https://sdss.org/dr18/targeting/fps/"> for further details on skies target selection.

### Naming Convention
$MOS_TARGET/[V_TARG]/mos_target_skies_v2-[NUM].fits, where V_TARG=1.0.1 for DR18; and NUM = 1..1 to partition the file into parts

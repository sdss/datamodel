## Basic Information
DR1 fpBIN files (photo v5_3) A 4x4 binned version of the corrected image after sky-subtraction. The counts in each binned pixel are the average of the counts in its associated 16 unbinned pixels after a global sky and scattering wings of stars have been subtracted (fpC and fpBIN header keyword SKY), scaled up a factor of BINFAC (== 2^SHIFTED), with SOFTBIAS added afterwards. All pixels that are in atlas images are replaced by the background level before binning and sky subtraction, with suitable noise added. All of the header parameters from the raw image are inherited as well.\nEDR fpBIN files (photo v5_2) A 4x4 binned version of the corrected image. The counts in each binned pixel are the average of the counts in its associated 16 unbinned pixels, scaled up a factor of BINFAC (== 2^SHIFTED). All pixels that are in atlas images are replaced by the background level before binning, with suitable noise added. All of the header parameters from the raw image are inherited as well.

### Naming Convention
fpBIN-rrrrrr-bc-ffff.fit,
where <i>rrrrrr</i> is the imaging run number, <i>b</i> is the filter used
(u, g, r, i, or z), <i>c</i> is the column location in the Imaging Array of
the CCD which acquired the data (1-6), and <i>ffff</i> is the
field number within the run.

## Basic Information
The MaNGA DRP provides regularly-gridded cubes (with both logarithmic and linear wavelength solutions) that combine information from all exposures of a given galaxy.  The cubes are three-dimensional arrays in which the first and second dimensions are spatial (with regular 0.5 arcsec square spaxels) and the third dimension represents wavelength.

### Naming Convention
<code>manga-[plate]-[ifudesign]-[type]CUBE.fits.gz</code>, where <code>[plate]</code> is the plate number, <code>[ifudesign]</code> is the design IFU size and number, and <code>[type]</code> is either LOG or LIN indicating whether the file uses a logarithmic or linear based wavelength solution.  The combined <code>[plate]-[ifudesign]</code> is also known as the 'plate-ifu' designation of a given galaxy.

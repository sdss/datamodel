## Basic Information
spFrame contains the non-calibrated spectra from the red- or blue-half of a single exposure. It is structurally the same as spCFrame which contains the calibrated spectra, except for the wavelength solution in HDU 3: spFrame uses a compact trace-set structure format while spCFrame uses an evaluated image for the log10(wavelength) at each pixel for each fiber.

### Naming Convention
Filenames have the form spFluxcorr-[c][n]-eeeeeeee.fits.gz, where c indicates either a blue or red spectrograph, n indicates the spectrograph number (1 or 2) and eeeeeeee indicates the exposure number.

### Releases
DR9, DR10, DR12, DR11, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX

### Approximate Size
16 KB

### File Type

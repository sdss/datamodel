## Basic Information
The final reduced spectra for MaNGA targets observed with the
Green Bank Telescope under project AGBT16A_095. All spectra have had
strong RFI removed and have been boxcar and hanning smoothed to a
final resolution of ~10 km/s. Velocities are calculated using the
optical approximation for low redshifts (i.e. velocity = c(1.420405752
GHz)/f_obs - 1) where f_obs is the observed frequency). Both pre- and
post-baseline subtracted spectra are provided. Notes on individual objects can be found <a href="https://dr15.sdss.org/sas/dr15/manga/HI/v1_0_1/observing/GBT16A_095/notes/">here</a>.

### Naming Convention
<code>mangaHI-[PLATE]-[IFUDSGN]\.fits</code>, where <code>[PLATE]</code> is the plate number and <code>[IFUDSGN]</code> is the IFU size and number.

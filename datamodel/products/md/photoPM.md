## Basic Information
Recalculated proper motions using the methods of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AJ....127.3034M">Munn et al. 2004, AJ,
127, 5, 3034-3042</a> . Munn et al. recalibrate USNO-B positions using SDSS
galaxies, and recompute proper motions including both the USNO-B and
SDSS positions. Statistical errors in the USNO-B proper motions are
decreased by roughly 20%-30%, systematic errors are greatly reduced,
and the proper motions are placed on an absolute reference
frame. Requiring a match to an SDSS object removes the large number of
false high proper motion objects in USNO-B. The resultant catalog is
90% complete to g < 19.7, with statistical errors in the component
proper motions of roughly 3-3.5 mas/yr, substantially smaller
systematic errors, and a contamination rate of less than 0.5%.
Identification information for the SDSS source is given.

## Basic Information
The spec-PLATE-MJD-FIBER.fits files contain a repackaging of all spectral data for a given plugging (plate, mjd, fiber), including both the coadded spectrum and optionally the individual exposure frames. This groups the information from <a href="../../PLATE4/spFrame.html">spFrame</a>, <a href="../../PLATE4/spCFrame.html">spCFrame</a>, <a href="../../PLATE4/spFlat.html">spFlat</a>, <a href="../../PLATE4/spPlate.html">spPlate</a>, <a href="https://data.sdss5.org/dsi/file/select-spZbest/ipl/env-BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX">spZbest</a>, <a href="https://data.sdss5.org/dsi/file/select-spZline/ipl/env-BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX">spZline</a>, and <a href="../../spAll.html">spAll</a> so that for each object one only needs to read a single file. <pre>     HDU 0  : Header info from spPlate     HDU 1  : Coadded spectrum from spPlate     HDU 2  : Summary metadata copied from spAll     HDU 3  : Line fitting metadata from spZline     HDU 4+ : [Optional] Individual spCFrame spectra [B, R for each exposure] </pre> A <a href="../lite/PLATE4/spec.html">"lite" version of these files</a> also exists in the "lite" subdirectory tree. These contain HDUS 0-3, but do not have the individual frame data and thus are much smaller.

### Naming Convention
<code>spec-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{5}-[0-9]{4}\.fits</code>, where <code>[0-9]{4}</code> is a zero-padded, four-digit number containing the plate number, <code>[0-9]{5}</code> is a five-digit number containing the MJD number and <code>[0-9]{4}</code> is a four-digit number containing the fiber id.

### Releases

### Approximate Size
1 MB

### File Type

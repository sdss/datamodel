## Basic Information
Line measurements for fibers for
which the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has been run.
This file is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN product. It
is designed to be line-by-line matched with
the <a href="specObj.html"> specObj</a> list of all spectra.  Any
spectra in specObj that do not have a measurement from the MPA-JHU
pipeline have all values zeroed out in this file.  There is further
information about the MPA-JHU results in the parallel
files <a href="galSpecInfo.html">
galSpecInfo</a> , <a href="galSpecIndx.html"> galSpecIndx</a> ,
and <a href="galSpecExtra.html"> galSpecExtra</a> . ID values
in <a href="galSpecInfo.html"> galSpecInfo</a> are set to -1 for cases
where there were no results from the MPA-JHU pipeline. In some cases,
the pipeline was run but we don't believe the results are reliable, in
which case the column "RELIABLE"
in <a href="galSpecInfo.html">galSpecInfo</a> is set to zero.

 | OIII_VOFF | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The velocity offset of the [O III]5007 line from a free fit  (km s<sup>-1</sup>) |
 | OIII_CHI2 | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | chi^2 of the fit to the [O III]5007 line in free fit |
 | SPECTOFIBER | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The multiplicative scale factor applied to the original flux and error spectra prior to measurement of the emission lines to improve the spectrophotometric accuracy.  The rescaling insures that a synthetic r-band magnitude computed from the spectrum matches the r-band fiber magnitude measured by the photometric pipeline. |

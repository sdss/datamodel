## Basic Information
The apLSF store numerical LSFs, i.e. a 1D vector for each pixel position for the combined LSF in the apStar file, as well as Gauss-Hermite coefficients that represent this LSF.

### Naming Convention
<code> apSLSF-.+-[0-9]{5}\.fits</code>, where .+
(a.k.a. STARNAME) uniquely identifies each star and [0-9]{5} is
the 5-digit MJD number of the last data included in the combined
frames. There will also be a link, apLSF-STARNAME.fits to the latest
combined frame.

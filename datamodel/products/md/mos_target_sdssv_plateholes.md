## Basic Information
The combination of the dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta tables are a database representation of the SDSS-V platelist data product (https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/sdss/platelist/trunk/). These tables were used within early iterations of FPS target_selection as a way to communicate information about which targets had been included in SDSS-V plates. This information was used to e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected to have a good quality spectroscopic measurement by the end of the SDSS-V plate observations. The dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta table contains meta-data for each SDSS-V plate (one record per plate), whereas the dr19_sdssv_plateholes table has one entry for each drilled hole in each SDSS-V plate. The dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta tables should be joined via the yanny_uid field.  Mostly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/designs/DESIGNID6XX/DESIGNID6/plateDesign.html

##### Binary Table Caption for HDU1
Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | holetype | char[13] |  | type of hole to be drilled; one of SDSS, BOSS, MARVELS, APOGEE, GUIDE, CENTER, TRAP, or ALIGNMENT; this really refers to the instrument to be used, so for example SEGUE targets should be either SDSS or BOSS |
 | targettype | char[8] |  | type of target; one of SCIENCE, STANDARD, or SKY (if holetype is BOSS, SDSS, MARVELS or APOGEE); NA if not holetype is not one of the instruments (GUIDE, CENTER, TRAP, ALIGNMENT) |
 | sourcetype | char[4] |  | indicate the nature of the source, one of STAR, QSO, GALAXY, or NA (if targettype is NA) |
 | target_ra | float64 |  | right ascension, in J2000 deg |
 | target_dec | float64 |  | declination, in J2000 deg |
 | iplateinput | int32 |  | integer indicating which plateInput file from the list in the plateDefinition file this came from (1-indexed); -1 or 0 if the hole wasn't from a plateInput file. |
 | pointing | int32 |  | which pointing (1-indexed) this target is associated with; note this means which pointing among the ones that this plate is designed for, so if this a single pointing plate but uses the B-side MARVELS fibers, this will be "1", not "2" |
 | offset_integer | int32 |  | which offset this target is associated with; 0 means it is not associated with an offset, it is associated with the primary pointing |
 | fiberid | int32 |  | what fiber on the appropriate instrument (as listed in holetype) is assigned to this target (-9999 for none) |
 | block | int32 |  | which fiber block that fiber is associated with (-9999 for none) |
 | iguide | int32 |  | for guide holes, which guide fiber it is assigned to (from 1 to 11) (-9999 for non guide holes) |
 | xf_default | float32 |  | X position of hole in focal plane, given a default set of observing parameters (hour angle of zero, temperature of 5 deg C), in units of mm; for position angle of zero (which we always use), +X is +RA |
 | yf_default | float32 |  | Y position of hole in focal plane, given a default set of observing parameters (hour angle of zero, temperature of 5 deg C), in units of mm; for position angle of zero (which we always use), +Y is +Dec |
 | lambda_eff | float32 |  | wavelength to optimize hole location for, in Angstroms (platedesign will default to 5400 if not set) |
 | zoffset | float32 |  | backstopping offset distance, in microns (platedesign will default to 0 if not set) |
 | bluefiber | int32 |  | 1 if the BOSS instrument is meant to assign this target a "blue" fiber; 0 otherwise |
 | chunk | int32 |  | BOSS chunk number (0 if not appropriate) |
 | ifinal | int32 |  | 0-indexed position in BOSS final tiling file (-1 if not appropriate) |
 | origfile | char[1] |  | for BOSS targets, name of file that target originated within (for BOSS targets, one of the bosstarget files, for ancillary targets, a file within the directory. |
 | fileindx | int32 |  | for BOSS targets, 0-indexed position within ORIGFILE (-1 if not appropriate) |
 | diameter | float32 |  | diameter of hole to be drilled, in mm |
 | buffer | float32 |  | buffer to leave around hole edge for conflicts in mm |
 | priority | int32 |  | priority number assigned by the plateInput file; lower numbers indicate higher priority |
 | assigned | int32 |  | 1 if this was a target assigned to a fiber, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 1 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format. |
 | conflicted | int32 |  | 1 if this was a target not assigned because of a collision, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format. |
 | ranout | int32 |  | 1 if this was a target not assigned because we ran out of fibers, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format. |
 | outside | int32 |  | 1 if this was a target not assigned because it was too fare from the plate center, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format. |
 | mangaid | char[1] |  | MaNGA identifier |
 | ifudesign | int32 |  | intended IFU identified for this object |
 | ifudesignsize | int32 |  | number of fibers in intended IFU identified for this object |

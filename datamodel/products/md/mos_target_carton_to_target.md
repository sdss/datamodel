## Basic Information
The table stores the targets assigned to a given carton along with information about the instrument that will observe that target, and offseting data.

### Naming Convention
$MOS_TARGET/[V_TARG]/mos_target_carton_to_target-[NUM].fits, where V_TARG=1.0.1 for DR18; and NUM = 1..1 to partition the file into parts

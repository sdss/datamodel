## Basic Information
The photoField files contain the full, calibrated outputs of the SDSS
imager photometric pipeline regarding the properties of each field
in a camera dewar. They are parallel with the CAS
field and fieldProfile tables.

### Naming Convention
<code>photoField-[0-9]{6}-[1-6]\.fits</code>,
where <code>[0-9]{6}</code> is the zero-padded, six digit run number and
<code>[1-6]</code> is the camcol number.

### Releases
DR8, DR9, DR10, DR12, DR11, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
BOSS_PHOTOOBJ

### Approximate Size
880 KB

### File Type

## Basic Information
This file contains the parameters of all 2MASS sources
falling within at least one APOGEE field and any "special targets" that (for various reasons)
do not have 2MASS data.  These parameters include mid-IR data, proper motions, and additional
optical photometry acquired specifically for APOGEE.

### Naming Convention
<code>apogeeObject_DR[N]_[fieldname].fits</code>
<code>apogeeObject_DR[N].fits</code> (concatenation of all field files)

### Releases
DR12, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
APOGEE_TARGET

### Approximate Size
79 MB

### File Type
FITS

### Generated by Product
none

## Basic Information
There is one psBB bias vector (a.k.a. "better bias") per chip per field.
The original bias vectors, idB* files, are determined from calibration runs.
Corrected bias vectors, psBB* files, are (optionally) produced by PSP which
adds the scattered light correction to the original bias vectors.

### Naming Convention
psBB-rrrrrr-bc-ffff.fit,
where <i>rrrrrr</i> is the imaging run number (of the calibration run
which produced the vector), <i>b</i> is the filter used (u, g, r, i, or z), <i>c</i> is the column
location in the Imaging Array of the CCD which acquired the data (1-6),
and <i>ffff</i> is the file number.

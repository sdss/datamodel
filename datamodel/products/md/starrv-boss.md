## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY


#### HDU Type: IMAGE
#### HDU Size:  0 bytes

##### Header Table Caption for HDU0
Key | Value | Comment | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SIMPLE | True | conforms to FITS standard |
| BITPIX | 8 | array data type |
| NAXIS | 0 | number of array dimensions |
| EXTEND | True |  |



### HDU1: 


#### HDU Type: BINARY TABLE
#### HDU Size:  152 KB

##### Binary Table Caption for HDU1
Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | FCJD | float64[50] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Flux Centered Julian Date
    Array. Every array for a single plate is identical and contains all
    of the FCJDs for that plate. |
 | STARNAME | char[66] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | TYC Name, GCS Name, HIP Name, 2MASS Name |
 | RADEC | float64[2] | degrees | Right Ascension and Declination (J2000) |
 | ORDER | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | MARVELS Plate order (value 1-120) |
 | MAG | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Star V-Band Magnitude |
 | STARRV | float64[50] | m/s | Radial Velocity
    computed from the University of Florida 1D pipeline. |
 | BCV | float64[50] | m/s | Barycentric Velocity of
    corresponding RV measurement time. |
 | OFFSETERROR | float64 | m/s | Expected RV error for
    each order. It is based on the statistics of the entire MARVELS program and is a
    function of the star's magnitude and the typical quality of the order it
    is in. An RV with variations outside of this value are considered as
    actually showing the presence of a signal. |

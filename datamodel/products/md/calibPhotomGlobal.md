## Basic Information
This file contains the ubercalibration results for field in a given RUN/CAMCOL. Final calibration is given as the nanomaggies per count, the factor by which to multiply the raw counts of each object:\nnmgypercount = aterm × 100.4 × [kterm+kdot× (t-t0)]× airmass × flat\nNote that application of the full calibration requires the flat-field vectors in the second HDU as well.

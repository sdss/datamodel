## Basic Information
<p>The NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. The current NSA sample (v1_0_1)
was selected to include virtually all known redshifts out to about z
&lt; 0.15 for galaxies within the coverage of SDSS DR11. For each such
galaxy, we have created image mosaics from SDSS and GALEX and
rephotometered the ugriz bands plus the far and near ultraviolet bands
in a self-consistent manner. After cleaning a number of suspicious
cases the final catalog contains about 640,000 galaxies. See
http://nsatlas.org for more information.  recommend the use of the
elliptical Petrosian photometry from this catalog. K-corrected
absolute magnitudes are provided using kcorrect v4_2.</p>
<p>There are cases of elliptical Petrosian quantities in this file
with <code>_R</code> suffices (e.g. <code>PETRO_FLUX_R</code>), to
indicate that these are the original quantities determined for the
r-band, without corrections. They differ from the r-band values in the
arrays (e.g. <code>PETRO_FLUX[4]</code>) in those cases where the
Petrosian radius was undefined in the r-band. In those cases, the
quantities in the arrays assume a Petrosian radius of 5 arcsec.</p>
<p>All absolute magnitudes are given with <i>H<sub>0</sub> = 100 h km
s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup></i>, so should be interpreted as <i>M
- 5 log<sub>10</sub> h</i>.</p>

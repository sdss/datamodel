## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
The data in this primary HDU consists of bytes which
comprise a VOTABLE document.
The VOTable describes the metadata of the table contained
in the following BINTABLE extension.
Such a BINTABLE extension can be used on its own as a perfectly
good table, but the information from this HDU may provide some
useful additional metadata.

#### HDU Type: IMAGE

## Basic Information
Well-defined and characterized all-sky sample of classical Cepheids in the Milky Way, obtained by combining two time-domain all-sky surveys: Gaia DR2 (Gaia Col. 2018; see I/345) and All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee+ 2014AAS...22323603S) and presented in Inno+2021.   Inno+21 use parallax and variability information from Gaia  to select ~30000 bright (G<17) Cepheid candidates with M_K_{<}-1.  They analyze their ASAS-SN V-band light curves, determining periods  and classifying the light curves using their Fourier parameters.  This results in ~1900 likely Galactic Cepheids, Inno+21 estimate  to be >~90% complete and pure within their adopted selection criteria.

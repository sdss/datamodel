## Basic Information
This table includes associations between sdss_id identifiers and the best matched catalogid for each catalogue cross-match. Unlike dr19_sdss_id_stacked, this table contains multiple rows per sdss_id, one for each cross-match association. When multiple sdss_ids are associated with the same catalogid, the one with the lowest rank (rank=1) should be preferred. Note: The sdss_id match was extended internally for a more recent crossmatch not yet part of the publicly released data. As such, the ra/dec_sdss_id columns may differ from the catalogid coordinates.

 | sdss_id | int64 |  | The SDSS identifier for a unique object. |
 | catalogid | int64 |  | The associated catalogid for this target. |
 | version_id | int16 |  | The version of the cross-match associated with the catalogid. |
 | ra_sdss_id | float64 |  | The right ascension of the target in ICRS J2015.5 coordinates (taken from the highest version catalogid in dr19_sdss_id_stacked). |

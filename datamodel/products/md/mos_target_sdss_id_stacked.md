## Basic Information
This table includes associations between sdss_id identifiers and the matched catalogids for each catalogue cross-match. The table contains one row per sdss_id with columns for each catalogid version. However, catalogids may be associated with multiple sdss_id. dr19_sdss_id_flat is a pivoted/flattened version of this table and contains information about the preferred sdss_id for a catalogid. Note: The sdss_id match was extended internally for a more recent crossmatch not yet part of the publicly released data. As such, the ra/dec_sdss_id columns may differ from the catalogid coordinates.

## Basic Information
This file lists all of the match stars used for the astrometry comparison
between SDSS and a reference catalog for a given RUN and CAMCOL. It
contains the position and (where appropriate) proper motion offsets,
as well as some ancillary information useful to evaluating the
astrometry.

## Basic Information
Assignment results for cadence options for a given field. This file is written by the robostrategy script rs_assign. Each field is written out individually so that the process can be resumed smoothly if it dies; this information is ultimately summaries in the rsOptions file. The results here ignore assignment of calibration targets. They are used by rs_allocate in deciding how to allocate a cadence to each field.

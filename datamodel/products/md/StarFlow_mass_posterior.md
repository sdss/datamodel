## Basic Information
This file contains the full stellar mass posterior probability distributions for 378,720 evolved stars in SDSS-V DR19, derived using a normalizing flow model trained on asteroseismic masses. Each row corresponds to a star, and each column represents the relative likelihood at a specific log(mass) bin.

### HDU1: MASS_POSTERIORS
Mass posteriors. Each column is the likelihood at a specific log mass; column names (e.g., 0_470 is for 10^0.470 solar masses) indicate the mass value. Negative values indicated with underscore (e.g., _1_618 is for 10^-1.618 solar masses)

## Basic Information
This file has a format similar to the `confSummary` file, but it differs in that the coordinate values included are the measured values from the Field View Camera (FVC) image as opposed from the expected coordinates based on the targeting information for the given design.
The FVC determines the `alpha` and `beta` positions of each robotic fibre positioner by measuring the position of the backilluminatedmetrology fibres on the robot. The remaining coordinates (`wok`, `ra/dec`, `ra_observed/dec_observed`, etc.) are derived from the `alpha` and `beta` positions.

### Naming Convention
`$SDSSCORE_DIR/[OBS]/summary_files/[CONFIGSUBMODULE]/[CONFIGGRP]/confSummaryF-[CONFIGID].par` where `$SDSSCORE_DIR` is the environment variable pointing to the directory where the sdsscore GitHub repository has been checked out, `[CONFIGID]`` is the configuration identifier (a sequential integer assigned at the time of observation, e.g., 14802), `[OBS]`` is the observatory (`apo` or `lco`), `[CONFIGSUBMODULE]`` is a grouping of one thousand configurations (e.g., `014XXX``), and `[CONFIGGRP]`` is a grouping of one hundred configurations (e.g., `0148XX``). For each `confSummaryF` file there is always an associated `confSummaryF` file with the same `CONFIGID` in the same directory.

- Number of Rows: 1500

#### Structure
Name | Type | Unit | Description | Is Array | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | positionerId | short | N/A | The robotic fibre positioner identifier. | False | 3 |
 | holeId | char[28] | N/A | Hole identifier in which the positioner is located. | False | R-1C14 |
 | fiberType | FIBERTYPE | N/A | Type of fibre in this entry (APOGEE, BOSS, or Metrology). | False | APOGEE |
 | assigned | short | N/A | Whether this fibre was assigned to a target in the design (only one of the science fibres in a positioner can have `assigned=1`). | False | 0 |
 | on_target | short | N/A | Whether this fibre is on target. A fibre can be `assigned`` but not `on_target` for a number of reasons (e.g., the positioner is not working, a collision required the positioner to be moved, etc.) | False | 0 |
 | valid | short | N/A | Whether the alpha and beta angles are valid. Do not use targets with `valid=0`. | False | 1 |
 | decollided | short | N/A | Whether this positioner had to be moved to decollide it. This should also mean (`on_target=0`). | False | 0 |
 | too | short | N/A | Whether this entry is a target of opportunity (ToO). In this case the ToO replaced one of the initial science target assigned by robostrategy. The too entry was introduced in confSummaryF 14461 at APO and 10007788 at LCO. | False | 0 |

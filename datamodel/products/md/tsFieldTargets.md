## Basic Information
File describing photometric field for SDSS-I and -II, specifically
related to target selection in those surveys. This is information that
was extracted from the opdb (Operational Database). See
also <a href="http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/dm/flatFiles/tsField.html">the
original tsField data model</a>.

### Naming Convention
<code>tsField-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{5}-[0-9]-[0-9]-[0-9]-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}.fits</code>,
based on stripe, muStart, rerun, field start, and field end.

### Releases

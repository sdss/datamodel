## Basic Information
Contains cross-matches between the SDSS photoObj objects and the WISE
All-Sky Release catalog.  Please refer to
the <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec2_2a.html">WISE
catalog explanatory supplement</a> for full details on the WISE
catalog columns.  These files only include a subset of the columns.
<br/>

The astrometric matching uses a 4 arcsecond radius.  The matching is
many-to-many: SDSS objects may appear multiple times and WISE objects
may appear multiple times.

### Naming Convention
<code>photoWISE-[0-9]{6}-[1-6].fits</code>; <code>photoWISE-RRRRRR-C.fits</code>
for run RRRRRR and camcol C.

### Releases
DR10, DR12, DR11, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
BOSS_PHOTOOBJ

### Approximate Size
30 MB

### File Type
FITS

### Generated by Product

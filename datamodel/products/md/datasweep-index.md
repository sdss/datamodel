## Basic Information
File describing the location of each field in the <a href="RERUN/calibObj.html">calibObj</a> sweep files, to make
spatial searches on the sweep faster. Versions exist for the galaxies,
stars, and sky sweeps. Given an RA and Dec one can use this file to
find the nearby fields and find what the lines of the relevant sweep
files are that you need to read.

### Naming Convention
datasweep-index-[type].fits (where type is 'gal', 'star' or 'sky')

### Releases
DR8, DR9, DR10, DR12, DR11, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
PHOTO_SWEEP

### Approximate Size
38 MB

### File Type
FITS

### Generated by Product
photoop

## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
For IDL users, idlutils has a routine "sdss_sweep_circle" which
utilizes these sweep indices to do very fast spatial searches (you
can retrieve all objects within 3 deg radius in less than a
minute).

## Basic Information
The MAPS files are the primary output file from the DAP and
        provide 2D "maps" (i.e., images) of DAP measured properties. The
        shape and WCS of these images identically match that of a single
        wavelength channel in the corresponding DRP LOGCUBE file.  The
        primary header is an exact copy of the primary header for the
        DRP manga-PLATE-IFUDESIGN-LOGCUBE.fits.gz file, except that the
        BSCALE, BZERO, and BUNIT keywords are removed and the AUTHOR and
        MASKNAME keywords are changed.  Addional DAP-specific keywords
        are added to specify the analysis procedures used.

Most properties are provided in groups of three fits
        extensions:

<li>[property]: the measurement value,</li>
<li>[property]_IVAR: the measurement uncertainty stored as
            the inverse variance</li>
<li>[property]_MASK: a corresponding bit mask for each
            pixel.</li>

Extensions can either be a single 2D image (HDUCLAS1= 'IMAGE'
        <b>error</b>) or they can have a series of images that are
        organized along the third dimension (HDUCLAS1= 'CUBE'). For the
        latter, each image is said to be in a specific "channel".  For
        example, each Gaussian-fitted emission-line flux is provided in
        a single channel in the EMLINE_GFLUX extension.  All the main
        data extensions include:

<li>the WCS information,</li>
<li>the HDUCLASS keyword block,</li>
<li>the channel description for the multichannel extensions
            that provides the names of the quantities in each channel
            --- header keyword Cn is the data in channel n, where n is
            the 1-indexed number of the channel,</li>
<li>the units for any single image or datacube extensions
            (BUNIT), and</li>
<li>the DATASUM and CHECKSUM values. </li>

If the units for all maps in a given extension are the same, the
        unit is provided by the BUNIT header parameter.  Otherwise the
        units are given similarly to the channel names: a header keyword
        Un is the units for the data in channel n, where n is the
        1-indexed number of the channel.

### Naming Convention
<code>manga-[plate]-[ifudesign]-MAPS-[daptype]\.fits\.gz</code>,
        where <code>[plate]</code> is the plate number,
        <code>[ifudesign]</code> is the design IFU size and number, and
        <code>[daptype]</code> is the shorthand keyword for the specific
        configuration of the analysis procedures performed by the DAP.
        In this release DAPTYPE is either HYB10-GAU-MILESHC or
        VOR10-GAU-MILESHC.  The combined
        <code>[plate]-[ifudesign]</code> is also known as the
        'plate-ifu' designation of a given galaxy.

### HDU2: SPX_ELLCOO
Elliptical polar coordinates of each spaxel from the
            galaxy center --- R, R/R<sub>eff</sub>, theta --- based on
            the on-sky coordinates in HDU1 and the ECOOPA and ECOOELL
            parameters (typically taken from the NASA-Sloan atlas) in
            the primary header.  In the limit of tilted, infinitely thin
            disk, these are the in-plane disk radius and azimuth; the
            2nd channel is the radius normalized by the elliptical
            Petrosian effective radius from the NASA-Sloan atlas.

### HDU6: BINID
Numerical ID for spatial bins for the binned spectra,
            stellar-continuum results, emission-line moment results,
            emission-line model results, and spectral-index results.

It is important to understand that not all of the data
            in the MAPS are independent. In addition to covariance,
            measurements are repeated for a given binned spectrum in all
            the spaxels associated with that bin.  Therefore, if you
            are, e.g., fitting a model to the MAPS data or calculating
            azimuthal averages, you should pull out the binned
            quantities that are unique before proceeding. In addition to
            any associated MASK values, you should use the BINID
            extension (and, indeed, its main purpose is) to extract the
            unique (but still correlated) data to use in such an
            analysis.

This extension has one channel for each of the 5 main
            processing steps: binning, stellar-continuum and -kinematics
            fitting, emission-line moment measurements, emission-line
            Gaussian modeling, and spectral indices. Keep in mind the
            following:

<li>BINID == -1 means that the spaxel was not included
                in the analysis. For example, BINID values of -1 in the
                first BINID channel means that either the spaxel had
                insufficiently good/unmasked pixels or too low S/N to be
                included in the binning procedure. Any spaxel with BINID
                = -1 should also be masked as DONOTUSE in the respective
                property map.</li>
<li>A BINID may be &gt;-1 in one channel and = -1 in a
                different channel. For example, a spaxel in the binning
                BINID map may be &gt;-1 but be = -1 in the stellar-continuum
                BINID. This likely means that the spaxels were
                successfully binned, but the bin had S/N &lt; 1 meaning it
                was not analyzed by the stellar-continuum fitting
                module.</li>
<li> For the VOR binning case, the only difference in
                BINIDs is the -1 vs.  non-negative distinction described
                in the last point, except for the HYB binning scheme.
                For the HYB binning case, the emission-line moments,
                emission-line modeling, and spectral-index measurements
                are done on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis, meaning that the
                BINIDs are redetermined and is just a running number
                for the spaxels that were analyzed.  </li>

Example python code that extracts both the unique and
            unmasked data from a MAPS file to produce the g-band and
            H-alpha surface brightness profiles is provided in the
            DAP Tutorials.

### HDU8: BIN_LWELLCOO
Light-weighted elliptical polar coordinates of each bin
            from the galaxy center --- R, R/R<sub>eff</sub>, theta ---
            based on the on-sky coordinates in HDU1 and the ECOOPA and
            ECOOELL parameters (typically taken from the NASA-Sloan
            atlas) in the primary header.  In the limit of tilted,
            infinitely thin disk, these are the in-plane disk radius and
            azimuth; the 2nd channel is the radius normalized by the
            elliptical Petrosian effective radius from the NASA-Sloan
            atlas.

### HDU23: EMLINE_SFLUX
Non-parametric summed flux obtained after subtracting
            the stellar-continuum model.  The emission-line fluxes
            account for Galactic reddening using the E(B-V) reddening,
            extinction factor Rv, and specified extinction law as
            provided in the primary header (EBVGAL, RVGAL, GEXTLAW,
            respectively).

### HDU30: EMLINE_GFLUX
Gaussian profile integrated flux obtained from a
            combined continuum+emission-line fit.  The emission-line
            fluxes account for Galactic reddening using the E(B-V)
            reddening, extinction factor Rv, and specified extinction
            law as provided in the primary header (EBVGAL, RVGAL,
            GEXTLAW, respectively).  <b>The flux ratio of the [OIII],
            [OI], and [NII] lines are fixed and cannot be treated as
            independent measurements</b>.

### HDU37: EMLINE_GVEL
Line-of-sight velocity of the ionized gas relative to
            the input guess redshift, which is given as cz in SCINPVEL
            in the PRIMARY header and most often identical to the NSA
            redshift.  <b>The velocities of all lines are tied during
            the fitting process and cannot be treated as independent
            measurements</b>

### HDU40: EMLINE_GSIGMA
Gaussian profile velocity dispersion as would be
            measured from a direct Gaussian fit to the emission lines.
            These <em>must</em> be corrected using the data in the
            EMLINE_INSTSIGMA to obtain the astrophysical dispersion!
            <b>The velocity dispersions of the [OII], [OIII], [OI], and
            [NII] lines are tied and cannot be treated as independent
            measurements</b>.

### HDU44: EMLINE_TPLSIGMA
We fit the emission lines using pPXF using a set of
            emission-line templates.  Given the varying spectral
            resolution of the MaNGA data, we setup these templates to
            have a non-zero "template instrumental dispersion" that is
            the same as the MaNGA instrumental disperison up to some
            quadrature offset.  This extension provides the "template
            instrumental dispersion" at the location of each emission
            line. The velocity dispersion actually measured and returned
            by pPXF is the quadrature difference between the
            measurements in EMLINE_GSIGMA and the data in this
            extension.

### HDU49: SPECINDEX
A series of absorption-line and bandhead index
            measurements.  These are raw measurements on the MaNGA
            spectra.  Corrections are provided in the SPECINDEX_CORR
            extension to convert the measurements to 0 velocity
            dispersion at the MILES resolution.

### HDU52: SPECINDEX_CORR
Corrections that can be applied to data in the SPECINDEX
            extension to convert the measurements to 0 velocity
            dispersion at the MILES resolution.  <em>The corrections should
            be applied differently for indices of different units:</em>

For indices in units of angstrom (U* = 'ang' in the header):

specindex_ang_corr = SPECINDEX * SPECINDEX_CORR

and for magnitude units (U* = 'mag' in the header):

specindex_mag_corr = SPECINDEX + SPECINDEX_CORR

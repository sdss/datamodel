## Basic Information
Contains the output of the pyXCSAO package, a Python replication of IRAF XCSAO (https://github.com/mkounkel/pyxcsao, for the field epoch coadd. It contains the radial velocity measurements determined cross-correlating a spectrum with a grid of PHOENIX stellar models. The measurements are only valid for stars despite being produced for all fibers.

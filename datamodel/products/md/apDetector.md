## Basic Information
apDetector contains calibration information about each detector, specifically: gain, readout noise, and linearity. These are organized as follows:
HDU0: master header
HDU1: gain image (2048x2048)
HDU2: readout noise image (2048x2048)
HDU3: linearity correction coefficients (2048x2048x3): quadratic coefficients

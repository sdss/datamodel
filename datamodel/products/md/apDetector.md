## Basic Information
apDetector contains calibration information about each detector, specifically: gain,
readout noise, and linearity. These are organized as follows:
<pre>
HDU0: master header
HDU1: gain image (2048x2048)
HDU2: readout noise image (2048x2048)
HDU3: linearity correction coefficients (2048x2048x3): quadratic coefficients
</pre>

### Naming Convention
apDetector-[abc]-MJD5.fits, where MJD5 refers to the date when the calibration data used
to make the frame were obtained.

## Basic Information
The spPlate files contain the combined spectra for all exposures of
a given plate.  There are typically four 900s exposures which may
have been taken in a single night, or over multiple nights.  This page
is an updated summary of the <a href="http://spectro.astro.princeton.edu/#dm_spplate">SDSS2 spPlate data
model</a> .

### Naming Convention
 <i>spPlate-[p]-mmmmm.fits</i> , where <i>[p]</i> is a 4 or 5-digit plate number, and <i>mmmmm</i> is a 5-digit MJD.

### Releases
DR9, DR10, DR12, DR11, DR13, DR14, DR15, DR16, DR17

### Enviroments
BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX

### Approximate Size
106 MB

### File Type
FITS

### HDU2: ANDMASK
If a bit is set in this mask, it means that <em>every</em> input spectrum
  also had this bit set at this wavelength.  In this case the data should
  generally be discarded.  See the
  <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/algorithms/bitmasks/#SPPIXMASK">SPPIXMASK documentation</a>.

### HDU3: ORMASK
If a bit is set in this mask, it means that one of the input spectra
  had this bit set at this wavelength.  In most cases this region of that
  spectrum is then discarded for the coadd and the coadd is OK, but this
  bitmask serves as a warning that not all input spectra were included at
  this wavelength and why.

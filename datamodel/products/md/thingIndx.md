## Basic Information
This file contains the full list of unique primary objects (called "things") in the SDSS imaging survey. Because of the large number of rows, we keep only the minimal required information for each object. The zero-indexed position of any primary object in this file is called its "THING_ID", and is included in the full resolve information in the reObjGlobal files (and also is stored in the photoObj files). This index file gives you the information to link any detection to all other detections of the object through its THING_ID. All the detections of the object associated with a certain "thing_id" can be found in these elements of thingList: thingList[thingIndex[thing_id].istart:thingIndex[thing_id].istart+thingIndex[thing_id].ndetect-1]. The thingList file tells you which field and which object id numbers those detections correspond to.

## Basic Information
The gimg files are produced the guider camera.  These used to be stored with
raw spectro data in subdirectories like spectro/MJD/guider.  Presently those
are now stored separately in the gcam directory.  These are simple 16-bit FITS
images. <i>This file describes the old guider camera. For the current guider
camera see <a href="/datamodel/files/STAGING_DATA/gcam/MJD/gimg.html">gcam files</a>.</i> 

### Naming Convention
gimg[DDDD].fits, The four digits look like some kind of timestamp but bear
no resemblance to the times in the headers.  Probably they are simply a
sequence number.

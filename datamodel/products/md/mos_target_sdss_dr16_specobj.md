## Basic Information
This is a base table containing ALL the spectroscopic information, including a lot of duplicate and bad data. Use the SpecObj view instead, which has the data properly filtered for cleanliness. These tables contain both the BOSS and SDSS spectrograph data. NOTE: The RA and Dec in this table refer to the DR8 coordinates, which have errors in the region north of 41 deg in Dec. This change does not affect the matching to the photometric catalog.

### Naming Convention
$MOS_TARGET/[V_TARG]/mos_target_sdss_dr16_specobj-[NUM].fits, where V_TARG=1.0.1 for DR18; and NUM = 1..1 to partition the file into parts

### Releases
DR18

### Enviroments
MOS_TARGET

### Approximate Size
1 GB

### File Type
FITS

### Generated by Product
sdss5db> targetdb, operations database server

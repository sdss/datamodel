## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY


#### HDU Type: IMAGE
#### HDU Size:  0 bytes

##### Header Table Caption for HDU0
Key | Value | Comment | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SIMPLE | True | conforms to FITS standard |
| BITPIX | 8 | array data type |
| NAXIS | 0 | number of array dimensions |
| EXTEND | True |  |



### HDU1: 


#### HDU Type: BINARY TABLE
#### HDU Size:  308 MB

##### Binary Table Caption for HDU1
Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | FCJD | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Flux Centered Julian Date |
 | STARNAME | char[66] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | TYC Name, GCS Name, HIP
    Name, 2MASS Name |
 | RADEC | float64[2] | degrees | Right Ascension and
    Declination (J2000) |
 | ORDER | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | MARVELS Plate order (value 1-120) |
 | MAG | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Star V-Band Magnitude |
 | ORIG_FILENAME | char[88] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Filename of the
    original raw image. |
 | FLUX_1D_NORM | float64[4001] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | 1-dimensional
    continuum removed normalized stellar spectra. Processed through University
    of Florida 1D Pipeline. |
 | FLUX_1D_ORIG | float64[4001] | ADU | 1-dimensional
    non-normalized stellar spectra. Spectra have been bias subtracted and
    trace/deslanted/cosmic ray removed. |
 | PHOTONERROR | float64 | m/s | Photon limit of
    observation based on combined photon limits in the stellar spectra and
    corresponding Tio spectra used for calibration. |
 | STATERROR | float64 | m/s | Observed precision in the
    measurement of the Radial Velocity (RV) datapoint. (Each final RV value is the mean of the RV
    found in 34 boxes that a spectra is divided into; the satistical
    variance of these 34 values is used to estimate the quality of the
    measurement. It reflects the precision of the measurement, but not the
    actual accuracy since a systematic offset can create large error while
    maintaining consistent results across the boxes in the spectra.) |
 | REJECT | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | A value of 1 means the spectra
    was good. A NaN means it was rejected for a given reason (dead fiber,
    misplug, etc). |
 | WLSOLN | float64[4001] | Angstroms | Wavelength
    solution for stellar spectra as a function of pixel number, corrected for
    barycentric motion. Produced from University of Florida 1D Pipeline. |

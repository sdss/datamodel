## Basic Information
The combined list of targets from all
chunks[*] after they have been passed through the tiling code. This
file thus indicates which targets were assigned fibers and which
targets did not due to fiber collisions. This file is not the same as
a concatentation of the final-bossN files from each chunk, because
sections of many chunks have been "retiled", or newer chunks have
overlapped older chunks and assigned fibers to targets that were
originally collided. <br/> This file also contains the most up-to-date version of the target
selection flags so that a uniform sample of LRGs can be easily drawn
from the file. <br/> [*] - As per the name of the file, this file only contains targets
from boss2 through bossN. Boss1, the commissioning chunk, was
superceded by boss11. Chunks with numbers above 100 are for special
plates that do not necessarily target LRGs.  The file 
bosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss32.fits is the parent target catalog for 
DR10 and DR11 LSS catalogs.  bosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss38.fits is 
the parent catalog for DR12.

 | FINALN | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The chunk number N of the final-bossN file
    that this target came from (which can be different from the CHUNK field). |
 | FINALID | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The file index value from that final-bossN file.
    This and finalN constitute a unique identifier for each object in the
    collated file. |
 | ICOLLIDED | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | 1=did not receive fiber because in a
    collision group. 0 otherwise. |
 | COLL_GROUP_FINALID | int32[10] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Becuase the link lists in
    the original final-bossN files are now broken, this contains the
    FINALID values of the members of the collision group sorted in order
    of distance from the collided galaxy. When the collision group has 11
    or more members, only information for the closest 10 are given. |
 | COLL_GROUP_BOSSTARGET1 | int32[10] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The boss_target1
    bitmasks for each target in the list. THis is for quick reference as
    to whether a colliding target is a QSO, CMASS LRG, LOWZ LRG, etc. |
 | NASSIGNED | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | The number of finalN files in which a target
    was assigned a fiber. This rarely happens and is rarely larger than 2
    in practice. |
 | WHICHFINAL | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | A bitmask noting which final-bossN files
    the target received a fiber in. |
 | BOSS_TARGET1_009 | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | A bitmask that is similar to
    the boss_target1 bitmask, but this bitmask uses the target
    selection aglorithm from the main009 bosstarget file, which is the
    final target selection algorithm of the galaxy part of the BOSS
    survey. To select a uniform sample of CMASS or LOWZ galaxies,
    select on this bitmask. |
 | THINGID_DR8 | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Not currently used. |
 | THINGID_DR7 | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | Not currently used. |

## Basic Information
apStar files contain the spectral data for a given star.  apStar files
combine data from multiple visits, and combine the data from the three
chips. Spectra are resampled onto a simple logarithmic wavelength
scale. Both combined spectra as well as the resampled individual visit
spectra are output.

### Naming Convention
<code>apStar-.+-[0-9]{5}\.fits</code>, where .+ (a.k.a. STARNAME) uniquely identifies each star and [0-9]{5} is the 5-digit MJD number of the last data included in the combined frames. There will also be a link, apStar-STARNAME.fits to the latest combined frame.

### HDU1: 
Combined and individual spectra for star, at apStar sampling. Each
spectrum has 8575 columns with the spectra, and 2+NVISITS rows. The first
two rows are both combined spectra, with different weighting: first row
uses pixel-based weighting, while second uses a more "global" weighting.
If NVISITS=1, there will only be one row.

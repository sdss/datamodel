##### Binary Table Caption for HDU1
Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | rm_field_name | char[12] |  | Human readable name of the field (e.g. 'XMM-LSS', 'COSMOS', 'SDSS-RM') |
 | plate | int32 |  | PLATEID of the SDSS-V spectrum from which the visual inspection information was derived |
 | fiberid | int32 |  | FIBERID of the SDSS-V spectrum from which the visual inspection information was derived |
 | mjd | int32 |  | MJD of the SDSS-V spectrum from which the visual inspection information was derived |
 | catalogid | int64 |  | SDSS-V catalogid from version '0.1.0' of the crossmatch |
 | ra | float64 |  | PLUG_RA of the SDSS-V spectrum from which the visual inspection information was derived |
 | dec | float64 |  | PLUG_DEC of the SDSS-V spectrum from which the visual inspection information was derived |
 | rm_suitability | int32 |  | Flag indicating if this target is well suited to continued RM observation. Known values are: -1 - unconfirmed (but might still be a good QSO target, e.g. due to unplugged fiber, or unverified visual inspection); 0 - target is probably unsuitable for RM, do not observe in the future; 1 - target is probably suitable for RM |
 | in_plate | bool |  | flag indicating if this target was included in a plate design during SDSS-V plate observations |
 | firstcarton | char[17] |  | 'firstcarton' that selected this target for observation in the SDSS-V plate-mode operations phase |
 | mag_u | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (u-band)  |
 | mag_g | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (g-band)  |
 | mag_r | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (r-band)  |
 | mag_i | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (i-band)  |
 | mag_z | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (z-band)  |
 | gaia_g | float32 | mag | optical magnitude of the target (Gaia G-band)  |
 | date_set | char[11] |  | Human readable date string, e.g. '25-Nov-2020' that indicates roughly when this entry was added |
 | pkey | int64 |  | primary key of the table entry |

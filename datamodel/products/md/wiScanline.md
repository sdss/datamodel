## Basic Information
A description of unique geometrical
coverage of each field in a RUN/CAMCOL, including only those pixels
that are unique within the run and will not overlap the neighboring
strip in the same stripe (that is, approximately [64:1983,
64:1424]). The geometry is expressed in terms of a spherical polygon
for each field. Each spherical polygon is expressed as the
intersection on the sphere of a number of "caps." See the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle"> mangle documentation</a> for a full explanation.

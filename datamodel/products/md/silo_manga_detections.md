## Basic Information
This file contains information for strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens candidates and background galaxy candidates found within MaNGA galaxies contained within DR17 (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477..195T/abstract">Talbot et al. (2018)</a>, Talbot et al. in prep). The candidates are spectroscopically detected within co-added foreground subtracted row-stacked-spectra (RSS), in which spectra are stacked across exposures from the same fiber located at the same dither position so a sigma-clipping method can reject transient signals. The target and candidate overview information, spectra information, and emission-line analysis information are split into three extensions. Nearly all candidate background galaxies are highly assured but only source grade A through C represent if a candidate is suspected to be lensed.

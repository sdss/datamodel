## Basic Information
Each ft file contains one of the 120
spectra from the MARVELS1 instrument. Both stellar spectra and
calibration spectra get trimmed and copied to this directory for later
use.

### Naming Convention
For weighting purposes, a copy without the slit profile
illumination correction divided out is retained, and is named <i>ft_noFlat_SZZZ_MARVELS1.YYYY-MM-DDTRR:NN:CC.CCC.fits</i> ,
where <i>ZZZ</i> is a 3-digit spectrum number from 1-120, and <i>YYYY-MM-DDTRR:NN:CC.CCC
</i> is a standard IRAF-compatible calendar timestamp in UTC where <i>YYYY</i> is the year, <i>MM</i> is the month, <i> DD</i> is the day, <i> RR</i> is the hour, <i> NN</i> is the minute, <i> CC.CCC</i> is the seconds
field.

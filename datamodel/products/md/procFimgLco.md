### HDU5: POSITIONERTABLEMEAS
Contains all FVC based robot-fiber measurements.  Merge of POSITIONERTABLE (hdu2), WOKCOORDS (hdu3), POSANGLES (hdu8), and CENTROIDS (hdu9).  Merge is made by matching on holeID, and matching centroids to individual robot metrology fibers.

## Notes
FVC measurement methods continue to evolve overtime and so proc-fimg files from different dates may not exactly match this datamodel, which was built from an image from MJD 60648.  At somepoint we should reprocess them using the same software version.

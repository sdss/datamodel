## Basic Information
The gimg files are produced by the 2.5m Sloan Telescope guider camera. This file
is processed by the guider actor to produce <a href="proc-gimg.html">proc-
gimg</a> files, and to actually perform the guiding of the telescope. These are
16-bit FITS images, as read out of the Apogee Alta F47 guide CCD. Flat frames
are full readout (1024x1024 pixels), while dark and data frames are 2x2 binned
(512x512 pixels), each with their respective overscan region (24 or 12 pixels)
on one axis. Depending on guide star brightness, the observers may take the
guide images in "stack" mode, which median combines the requested number of
exposures to improve dynamic range. Stacked images are also used for start-of-
night darks. See the STACK and EXPTIMEN keywords for more details.

### Naming Convention
<code>gimg-[0-9]{4}.fits.gz</code>, where the number is the
frame sequence number, starting from 1 for the first frame of the night (usually
a dark frame).

## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
The primary HDU contains the raw 16-bit gcamera data as read from the APOGEE
F47 CCD. The header contains some minimal information about the telescope
position. The V_GCAM (V_ECAM) keyword was introduced in gcameraICC v2_1; prior to
that, the version of the gcameraICC used to acquire each image was not directly
tracked. GAIN, PIXELSC, and READNOIS were introduced initially for observations
at LCO on 57520 and became part of the data model for all gimgs in gcameraICC vXX.

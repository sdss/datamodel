## Basic Information
This table stores the targets associated with DR18 target selection cartons. Note that the targets in this table are unique, but a target can be associated with multiple cartons. That many-to-many relationship is encoded in the mos_target_carton_to_target table.

### Naming Convention
$MOS_TARGET/[V_TARG]/mos_target-[NUM].fits, where V_TARG=1.0.1 for DR18; and NUM = 1..1 to partition the file into parts

### Releases
DR18, DR19

### Enviroments
MOS_TARGET

### Approximate Size
91 MB

### File Type
FITS

### Generated by Product
sdss5db> targetdb, operations database server

### Is a VAC
False

### Data Level
2.3.3

### HDUS List for release DR19

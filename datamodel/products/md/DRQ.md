## Basic Information
DR10Q is the BOSS quasar catalog of the tenth data release of SDSS,
as documented in PÃ¢ris et al. (2013).  There are 2 sets of files available
in FITS format:
<ul>
<li>DR10Q.fits/.dat: The primary DR9Q catalog</li>
<li>Supplementary_DR10Q.fits/.dat: The supplementary list of quasars added
    after the primary catalog was frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This webpage documents the format of the
<a href="/sas/dr9/env/BOSS_QSO/DR10Q/DR10Q.fits">DR10Q.fits</a>
and <a href="/sas/dr9/env/BOSS_QSO/DR10Q/Supplementary_DR10Q.fits">Supplementary_DR10Q.fits</a>
catalog files which have identical formats with different objects.

## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
The data in this primary HDU consists of bytes which
comprise a VOTABLE document.
The VOTable describes the metadata of the table contained
in the following BINTABLE extension.
Such a BINTABLE extension can be used on its own as a perfectly
good table, but the information from this HDU may provide some
useful additional metadata.

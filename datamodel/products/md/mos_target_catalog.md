## Basic Information
The table stores the results of the cross-match used for DR18 targeting. All entries in this table are expected to be unique physical objects drawn from one or more parent catalogues. The mos_target_catalog_to_ tables provide the relationship between mos_target_catalog objects and their parent catalogue counterparts.

### Naming Convention
$MOS_TARGET/[V_TARG]/mos_target_catalog-[NUM].fits, where V_TARG=1.0.1 for DR18; and NUM = 1..1 to partition the file into parts

Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | CATALOGID | int64 |  | The SDSS identifier for a unique object in this cross-match run. |
 | IAUNAME | char[4] |  | The IAU-style name. Not used. |
 | RA | float64 | degrees | The right ascension of the target in ICRS coordinates for J2015.5. Taken from the lead parent catalogue |

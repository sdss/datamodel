## Basic Information
This is the final summary file of the MaNGA Data Analysis
        Pipeline (DAP).  It provides collated summary information about
        the DAP methods, and global metrics derived from the DAP
        analysis products useful for sample selection.

### Naming Convention
<code>dapall-[drpver]-[dapver]\.fits</code>,
        where <code>[drpver]</code> is the version of the MaNGA Data
        Reduction Pipeline (DRP) that produced the reduced data products
        and <code>[dapver]</code> is the version of the MaNGA Data
        Analysis Pipeline (DAP) that analyzed those products and
        generated this file.

### Releases

## Example HDU List


### HDU0: PRIMARY
HDU0 contains no data.  It provides the names for the lines
            in the emission-line summed-flux (ELS*) and Gaussian-fitted
            (ELG*) vectors, and the names (SPI*) and units (SPIU*) for
            the spectral-index vectors.

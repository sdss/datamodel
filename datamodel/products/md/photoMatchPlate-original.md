## Basic Information
These files contain the match of
each plate to SDSS photometry, sorted in the same way as the <a href="/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/runs/PLATERUN/plPlugMap.html">
plPlugMapP</a> files (that is, by design fiber number rather than the
actual plugged fiber number).  There are two matches: a pure
positional match, and a flux-based match.  The flux-based match is the
default to use.  The positional match finds the nearest primary object
within 2 arcsec, or if there is none, identifies the primary field
covering the given position. The actual data for the flux-based match
can be found in the <a href="photoPlate.html">photoPlate</a> file.

##### Binary Table Caption for HDU1
Name | Type | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | FLUX_OBJID | char[19] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | migration: description of keyword/column not found. Needs update |
 | RUN | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | SDSS drift scan run of match (or overlapping
primary field if no match) |
 | CAMCOL | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | SDSS drift scan camera column of match (or
overlapping primary field if no match) |
 | FIELD | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | field within SDSS drift scan of match (or
overlapping primary field if no match) |
 | FLUX_ID | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | migration: description of keyword/column not found. Needs update |
 | THING_ID | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | unique integer associated with primary
matching object (see the <a href="/datamodel/files/PHOTO_RESOLVE/thingIndex.html">thingIndex
file</a>) |
 | RERUN | char[3] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | reprocessing number for reductions
associated with the SDSS run of this match (or of primary field if no
match) |
 | NOBSERVE | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | number of observations of the location
of the flux-based match, or if no match of the desired match location
(MATCH_RA, MATCH_DEC). |
 | NDETECT | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | number of detections associated with
the flux-based match |
 | FLUX_RA | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | right ascension, J2000 deg, for flux-based
match (or 0 if none) [called "RA" in DR8] |
 | FLUX_DEC | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | declination, J2000 deg, for flux-based
match (or 0 if none) [called "DEC" in DR8] |
 | MATCH_RA | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | right ascension, J2000 deg, of desired
match location |
 | MATCH_DEC | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | declination, J2000 deg, of desired
match location |
 | ORIG_OBJID | char[19] | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | migration: description of keyword/column not found. Needs update |
 | ORIG_ID | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | object id within SDSS field of positional
match (or 0 if no such match) |
 | ORIG_RA | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | right ascension, J2000 deg, for flux-based
match (or 0 if none) |
 | ORIG_DEC | float64 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | declination, J2000 deg, for flux-based
match (or 0 if none) |
 | APERFLUX3_R | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | aperture flux within 3 arcsec
diameter aperture in the r-band (in fact, an interpolation between
APERFLUX[2,2] and APERFLUX[3,2] from the <a href="/datamodel/files/BOSS_PHOTOOBJ/RERUN/RUN/CAMCOL/photoObj.html">
photoObj</a> files); this value corresponds to a measurement of
child associated with the positional match (that is the ORIG_ID
object); if no positional match, set to 0 |
 | FIBERFLUX_R | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | fiber flux within 3 arcsec diameter
aperture in the r-band, again for the ORIG_ID object; however, photo
measures this value from the parent, but at the location of the child
center; thus, the flux-based code looks for cases where APERFLUX3_R is
much less than FIBERFLUX_R to flag for further checking |
 | APERFLUX3_R_TOTAL | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | flux measured from the parent
object atlas image within a 3 arcsec diameter aperture of (MATCH_RA, MATCH_DEC), for
reference (not used in the flux-based matching algorithm); if this
doesn't need to be checked, it is set to zero |
 | APERFLUX3_R_MATCH | float32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | flux measured from the
flux-based match object atlas image within a 3 arcsec diameter aperture of
(MATCH_RA, MATCH_DEC); the flux-based matching selects the child with
the largest value of this flux; if this doesn't need to be checked, it
is set to zero |
 | FLUXMATCH_PARENT | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | parent that the flux-based
matching used in its checks (0 if none --- that is, if the positional
match worked and had a reasonable ratio of APERFLUX3_R/FIBERFLUX_R, or
if the positional match failed but there was no parent overlapping
(MATCH_RA, MATCH_DEC) in the primary field |
 | FLUXMATCH_STATUS | int32 | migration: unit of keyword/column not found. Needs update | bitmask reporting status of the
match (see description above) |

## Basic Information
The photoObj files contain the full, calibrated outputs of the SDSS
imager photometric pipeline. They are parallel with the CAS
photoObjAll and photoProfile tables. All "magnitudes" in this file are
of the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/help/glossary/#asinh">asinh</a> type.

### Naming Convention
<code>photoObj-[0-9]{6}-[1-6]-[0-9]{4}\.fits</code>, where
<code>[0-9]{6}</code> is a zero-padded six-digit
number containing the run number, <code>[1-6]</code> is the camera column ('camcol') and
<code>[0-9]{4}</code> is the zero-padded, four-digit frame sequence number.

### Releases

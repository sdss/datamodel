## Basic Information
Information about fibers for which
the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has been run.  This file
is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN product. It is
designed to be line-by-line matched with the <a href="specObj.html">
specObj</a> list of all spectra. ny spectra in specObj that do not
have a measurement from the MPA-JHU pipeline have all values zeroed
out in this file.  There is further information about the MPA-JHU
results in the parallel files <a href="galSpecIndx.html">
galSpecIndx</a> , <a href="galSpecLine.html"> galSpecLine</a> ,
and <a href="galSpecExtra.html"> galSpecExtra</a> . ID values are set
to -1 for cases where there were no results from the MPA-JHU
pipeline. In some cases, the pipeline was run but we don't believe the
results are reliable, in which case the column "RELIABLE" is set to
zero.

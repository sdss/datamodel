This\nfile thus indicates which targets were assigned fibers and which\ntargets did not due to fiber collisions. This file is not the same as\na concatentation of the final-bossN files from each chunk, because\nsections of many chunks have been \"retiled\", or newer chunks have\noverlapped older chunks and assigned fibers to targets that were\noriginally collided. <br/> This file also contains the most up-to-date version of the target\nselection flags so that a uniform sample of LRGs can be easily drawn\nfrom the file. <br/> [*] - As per the name of the file, this file only contains targets\nfrom boss2 through bossN. Boss1, the commissioning chunk, was\nsuperceded by boss11. Chunks with numbers above 100 are for special\nplates that do not necessarily target LRGs.  The file \nbosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss32.fits is the parent target catalog for \nDR10 and DR11 LSS catalogs.  bosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss38.fits is \nthe parent catalog for DR12.",

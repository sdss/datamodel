  name: mos_target_targeting_generation_to_carton
  short: 'MOS Target table: mos_target_targeting_generation_to_carton'
  description: A 'targeting_generation' describes a collection of versioned cartons,
    together with their robostrategy control parameters. This is a convenient way
    to describe the specific set of carton-versions that were used (and the way that
    they were treated) within any particular run of robostrategy.  The dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton
    table describes a many-to-many relationship, connecting each targeting_generation
    to a set of entries in the dr19_carton table, as well as recording how those carton-versions
    were treated in the robostrategy code (i.e. the rs_stage and rs_active parameters).  Taken
    together, the dr19_targeting_generation, dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton and
    dr19_targeting_generation_to_version tables duplicate, in a database form, the
    robostrategy carton configuration information available via the rsconfig product
    (https://github.com/sdss/rsconfig).

  short: 'MOS Target Table: skies_v2'
  description: This table stores the positions used as blank sky regions for DR18
    targetting. The sky regions are selected by dividing the sky in tiles of HEALpix
    nside 32. Each tile is then subdivided in candidate regions of HEALpix nside 32768
    and the pixels that meet the isolation requirements are considered valid skies.
    This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href="https://sdss.org/dr18/targeting/fps/">
    for further details of the process by which suitable sky locations are selected
    in SDSS-V/FPS.

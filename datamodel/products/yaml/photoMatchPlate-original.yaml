  description: 'These files contain the match of

    each plate to SDSS photometry, sorted in the same way as the <a href="/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/runs/PLATERUN/plPlugMap.html">

    plPlugMapP</a> files (that is, by design fiber number rather than the

    actual plugged fiber number).  There are two matches: a pure

    positional match, and a flux-based match.  The flux-based match is the

    default to use.  The positional match finds the nearest primary object

    within 2 arcsec, or if there is none, identifies the primary field

    covering the given position. The actual data for the flux-based match

    can be found in the <a href="photoPlate.html">photoPlate</a> file.'

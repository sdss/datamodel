  description: 'This file contains the full list of balkans used in the determination

    of the window function. The balkans consist of all the disjoint

    spherical

    polygons defined by the overlapping fields in the survey. Each

    spherical polygon is expressed as the intersection on the sphere of a

    number of "caps." See the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle"> mangle
    documentation</a> for a full explanation. Because of

    the vast number of these polygons, the definition of the balkan is split into

    two files, this "window_blist" file and the corresponding <a href="window_bcaps.html">window_bcaps.fits</a>
    file.'

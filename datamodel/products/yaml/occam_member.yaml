    The OCCAM member summary table provides positional, identification, and membership information for
    1196 candidate open cluster member stars.
  description: >
    The OCCAM member summary table provides the proper motion membership probabilities from Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2020 and
    Hunt and Reffert 2023 alongside the radial velocity and [Fe/H] membership probabilities from MWM/APOGEE. Basic postional information is
    included with source IDs from Gaia DR2/3 and SDSS-V DR19 for each star in the table.

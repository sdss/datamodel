  description: 'This file contains the match between balkans and fields in the window

    function.  The balkans are the full list of disjoint polygons defined

    by the overlap of all of the fields. There is a many-to-many

    relationship between the balkans and the fields: each field can be

    broken up into many balkans, and each balkan is covered by many

    fields. This file contains all matches between balkans and fields,

    sorted in order of field index.  The corresponding file <a href="window_bindx.html">window_bindx.fits</a>
    contains the same

    matches but sorted by balkan index.'

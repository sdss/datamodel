  description: 'This file contains the full list of catalog entries for the resolved

    survey. Because of the large number of rows, we keep only the minimal

    required information for each object. Usually this file is used by

    starting with an object''s THING_ID, looking up that row in the <a href="thingIndex.html">thingIndex.fits</a>
    file, and determining the

    row(s) of thingList to look at from that. The rows of thingList have

    all of the detections of the object you started with. Put another way,

    all the detections of the object associated with a certain "thing_id"

    can be found in these elements of thingList:

    thingList[thingIndex[thing_id].istart:thingIndex[thing_id].istart+thingIndex[thing_id].ndetect-1].'

  description: 'Information about fibers for which

    the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has been run.  This file

    is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN product. It is

    designed to be line-by-line matched with the <a href="specObj.html">

    specObj</a> list of all spectra. ny spectra in specObj that do not

    have a measurement from the MPA-JHU pipeline have all values zeroed

    out in this file.  There is further information about the MPA-JHU

    results in the parallel files <a href="galSpecIndx.html">

    galSpecIndx</a> , <a href="galSpecLine.html"> galSpecLine</a> ,

    and <a href="galSpecExtra.html"> galSpecExtra</a> . ID values are set

    to -1 for cases where there were no results from the MPA-JHU

    pipeline. In some cases, the pipeline was run but we don''t believe the

    results are reliable, in which case the column "RELIABLE" is set to

    zero.'

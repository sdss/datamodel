  description: 'This file contains the information

    about the targeting in the SDSS DR7 Legacy survey. It contains various

    status bits derived from tsField files pulled out of the final opdb

    from SDSS-II. Additionally, we have determined the versions of target

    and photo used for each field.  Finally, the geometry of each field

    that was used for targeting is included. The geometrical information

    describing the area of the field used for targeting is in mangle-type

    format (see the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle"> mangle

    documentation</a> for a full explanation).'

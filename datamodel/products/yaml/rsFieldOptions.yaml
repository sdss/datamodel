  short: Assignment results for cadence options for field
  description: Assignment results for cadence options for a given field. This file
    is written by the robostrategy script rs_assign. Each field is written out individually
    so that the process can be resumed smoothly if it dies; this information is ultimately
    summaries in the rsOptions file. The results here ignore assignment of calibration
    targets. They are used by rs_allocate in deciding how to allocate a cadence to
    each field.

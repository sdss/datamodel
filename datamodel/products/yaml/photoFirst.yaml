  description: 'Match of objects in a field of an

    SDSS imaging catalog to the <a href="http://sundog.stsci.edu/">FIRST</a> radio
    survey catalog (2008

    version). These matches are to any objects which

    are RUN_PRIMARY according to the local resolve (see <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/algorithms/resolve/">resolve

    documentation</a> ). Results are reported for all objects, and "first_skyrms"

    reports the noise level of FIRST at each location.'

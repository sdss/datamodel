  name: rsCompleteness
  short: Summary completeness file for a run
  description: Summarizes completeness for a run, including target-by-target completeness
    and healpix maps as a function of target type. Produced by robostrategy script
    rs_completeness. The HDUs beyond the first are healpix maps of the completeness.
    They come in triplets, with the number of targets, number of targets satisfied,
    and the fraction of targets satisfied (-1 if no targets in the pixl). HDU2-4 are
    summary statistics for all science targets. The next set of 3*NCADENCE HDUs are
    the healpix maps for each cadence group (name of cadence group is in CADENCE header
    keywords for each HDU). The following set of 3*NCARTON HDUs are the healpix maps
    for each carton (name of carton is in CARTON header keyword for each HDU). In
    this datamodel, we only list HDU2 through HDU4 since there are a variable number
    of the subsequent HDUs.

  description: 'Contains cross-matches between the SDSS photoObj objects and the WISE

    All-Sky Release catalog.  Please refer to

    the <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec2_2a.html">WISE

    catalog explanatory supplement</a> for full details on the WISE

    catalog columns.  These files only include a subset of the columns.

    <br/>


    The astrometric matching was done as follows.  First, the "gal" and

    "star" datasweep files were loaded and combined.  Then, a

    nearest-neighbor astrometric matching was performed to each of the

    WISE "slices" (Dec ranges).  This matching records only the nearest

    SDSS object for each WISE object, to a maximum distance of 4

    arcseconds.  Once all these matches were finished, the results were

    combined by inserting the single-slice matches into a table that is

    parallel to the "star" and "gal" datasweep files.  For this reason,

    there may be some slight oddities near the WISE "slice" boundaries.

    But to first order, each WISE object appears at most once.

    <br/>


    These files are "parallel" to the datasweep files; row 0 of the

    "wisematch" file contains the WISE object matching row 0 of the

    "calibObj" datasweep file.  The row will contain null values if there

    is no such match; you could check the "sweep_index" column to identify

    valid matches: value "-1" indicates no match.'

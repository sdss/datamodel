  description: 'apVisit files have data from a visit for each star, along with an

    initial RV measurement;

    this is the level where files are split by fiber with an associated

    format change: the three chips are now included as separate rows in each

    HDU (since these contain data only from a single fiber).

    Native wavelength sampling is still preserved;

    wavelength solution coefficients are now moved to individual headers.'

  description: '<p>The NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. The current NSA sample (v1_0_1)

    was selected to include virtually all known redshifts out to about z

    &lt; 0.15 for galaxies within the coverage of SDSS DR11. For each such

    galaxy, we have created image mosaics from SDSS and GALEX and

    rephotometered the ugriz bands plus the far and near ultraviolet bands

    in a self-consistent manner. After cleaning a number of suspicious

    cases the final catalog contains about 640,000 galaxies. See

    http://nsatlas.org for more information.  recommend the use of the

    elliptical Petrosian photometry from this catalog. K-corrected

    absolute magnitudes are provided using kcorrect v4_2.</p>

    <p>There are cases of elliptical Petrosian quantities in this file

    with <code>_R</code> suffices (e.g. <code>PETRO_FLUX_R</code>), to

    indicate that these are the original quantities determined for the

    r-band, without corrections. They differ from the r-band values in the

    arrays (e.g. <code>PETRO_FLUX[4]</code>) in those cases where the

    Petrosian radius was undefined in the r-band. In those cases, the

    quantities in the arrays assume a Petrosian radius of 5 arcsec.</p>

    <p>All absolute magnitudes are given with <i>H<sub>0</sub> = 100 h km

    s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup></i>, so should be interpreted as <i>M

    - 5 log<sub>10</sub> h</i>.</p>'

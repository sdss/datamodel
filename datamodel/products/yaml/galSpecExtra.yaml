  description: 'Physical parameter measurements for

    fibers for which the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has

    been run.  This file is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN

    product. It is designed to be line-by-line matched with the <a href="specObj.html">
    specObj</a> list of all spectra. Any

    spectra in specObj that do not have a measurement from the MPA-JHU

    pipeline have all values zeroed out in this file. There is further

    information about the MPA-JHU results in the parallel files <a href="galSpecInfo.html">
    galSpecInfo</a> , <a href="galSpecLine.html">

    galSpecLine</a> , and <a href="galSpecIndx.html"> galSpecIndx</a> . ID

    values in <a href="galSpecInfo.html"> galSpecInfo</a> are set to -1

    for cases where there were no results from the MPA-JHU pipeline. In

    some cases, the pipeline was run but we don''t believe the results are

    reliable, in which case the column "RELIABLE" in <a href="galSpecInfo.html">galSpecInfo</a>
    is set to zero.'

              the fibre. For those objects where the emission lines within the fibre
              do not provide an estimate of the SFR, model fits were made to the integrated

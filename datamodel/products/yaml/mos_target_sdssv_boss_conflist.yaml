  description: 'The dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist table is a database representation of
    an early version of the SDSS-V BOSS fieldlist data product.  The dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist
    table was used within early iterations of FPS target_selection as a way to communicate
    information about which SDSS-V plates had been observed by the time of target
    selection. This information was used to e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected
    to have a good quality spectroscopic measurement before the start of SDSS-V FPS
    operations.  Caution. The dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist table should only be used in
    order to recreate the target_selection selection function.  Column descriptions
    are mainly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/platelist.html'

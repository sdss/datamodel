  short: 'MOS Target Table: catalog'
  description: The table stores the results of the cross-match used for DR18 targeting.
    All entries in this table are expected to be unique physical objects drawn from
    one or more parent catalogues. The mos_target_catalog_to_ tables provide the relationship
    between mos_target_catalog objects and their parent catalogue counterparts.

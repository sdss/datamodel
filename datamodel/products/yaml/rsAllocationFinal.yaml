  short: Allocation for each field in this robotstrategy run (version for targetdb
    load)
  description: Allocation for each field in this robostrategy run (version for targetdb
    load). Produced by the robostrategy script final_allocation. This differs from
    the intermediate version (rsAllocation) because it splits mixed cadences into
    individual entries. If a field is split into two entries, each entry has the same
    fieldid but each entry has a different cadence. For example, a field with fieldid=10
    and cadence=mixed2_single_10x1 will be split into two entries, both with fieldid=10,
    one with cadence=mixed2_single_2x1 (two dark exposures) and one with cadence=bright_single_8x1
    (the bright exposures from mixed2_single_10x1). The exposure range in the rsFieldAssignmentsFinal
    file is provided for each entry. The fieldid is also changed (the original is
    stored as rs_fieldid here).

  description: 'This file is a FITS binary table identical in form to the spZbest
    file,

    but with all the fits ever done to each object.  This includes 5

    possible galaxy redshifts, 5 possible QSO redshifts, and 1 for each

    of many types of stars.  They are rank-sorted for each object,

    letting you go through and keep asking "but what''s the next best fit?".

    This is what the IDL procedure PLOTSPEC

    uses when the ZNUM keyword is specified.

    For example, ZNUM=2 will over-plot the 2nd-best fit eigenspectrum.'

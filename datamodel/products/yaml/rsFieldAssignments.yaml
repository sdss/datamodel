  name: rsFieldAssignments
  short: Target assignments for a particular field
  description: Targets in the area around a particular field and their assignments
    within this field. Each entry is an entry from the carton_to_target table in targetdb
    and has a unique RSID. Different RSIDs can correspond to the same CATALOGID (and
    thus actually be the same object), but may have different desired cadence or spectrograph
    requirements. Produced by the robostrategy script rs_assign_final, using the tofits()
    method of the Field class. Can be read in by fromfits() method of the Field class.

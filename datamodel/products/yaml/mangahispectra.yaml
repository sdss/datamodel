  description: 'The final reduced spectra for MaNGA targets observed with the

    Green Bank Telescope under project AGBT16A_095. All spectra have had

    strong RFI removed and have been boxcar and hanning smoothed to a

    final resolution of ~10 km/s. Velocities are calculated using the

    optical approximation for low redshifts (i.e. velocity = c(1.420405752

    GHz)/f_obs - 1) where f_obs is the observed frequency). Both pre- and

    post-baseline subtracted spectra are provided. Notes on individual objects can
    be found <a href="https://dr15.sdss.org/sas/dr15/manga/HI/v1_0_1/observing/GBT16A_095/notes/">here</a>.'

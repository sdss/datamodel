  short: 'MOS Target table: mos_target_sdssv_plateholes'
  description: 'The combination of the dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta
    tables are a database representation of the SDSS-V platelist data product (https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/sdss/platelist/trunk/).
    These tables were used within early iterations of FPS target_selection as a way
    to communicate information about which targets had been included in SDSS-V plates.
    This information was used to e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected to
    have a good quality spectroscopic measurement by the end of the SDSS-V plate observations.
    The dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta table contains meta-data for each SDSS-V plate
    (one record per plate), whereas the dr19_sdssv_plateholes table has one entry
    for each drilled hole in each SDSS-V plate. The dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta
    tables should be joined via the yanny_uid field.  Mostly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/designs/DESIGNID6XX/DESIGNID6/plateDesign.html'

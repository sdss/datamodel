    It is kept compressed under "bzip2", which we

    have found is the most efficient compressor of this format.  In

    addition, there is a lossy compression applied to the floating point

    values (which retains accuracy at the 0.1 percent level). The IDL

    routine "read_frame.pro" in photoop will back out the calibration and

    sky-subtraction from this file if necessary, in steps explained

    below. Also explained below is how to calculate the noise in the

    image.'

        description: 'The "image", a 2048x1489 array of floating point values, the

          calibrated and sky-subtracted version of the fpC "corrected frame"

          files produced by photo. Units are in

          <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/help/glossary/#nanomaggie">nanomaggies</a>.

          The header has additional WCS information.  These have been altered

          from the fpC versions to correct for any offsets from the astrom

          solutions found in the asTrans files.

          The image itself has had the FLOATCOMPRESS algorithm

          (see the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/software/idlutils/">idlutils</a>
          package)

          applied to it, keeping 10 significant binary digits. This approach guarantees
          that the

          precision is kept strictly within 0.1 percent per pixel, and allows a very
          efficient

          compression using bzip2. No special scaling or adjustment need be

          applied to the values when read in.'

          The header has additional WCS information.  These have been altered

          from the fpC versions to correct for any offsets from the astrom

          solutions found in the asTrans files.

          The image itself has had the FLOATCOMPRESS algorithm

          (see the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/software/idlutils/">idlutils</a>
          package)

          applied to it, keeping 10 significant binary digits. This approach guarantees
          that the

          precision is kept strictly within 0.1 percent per pixel, and allows a very
          efficient

          compression using bzip2. No special scaling or adjustment need be

          applied to the values when read in.'

          files produced by photo. Units are in

          <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/help/glossary/#nanomaggie">nanomaggies</a>.

          The header has additional WCS information.  These have been altered

          from the fpC versions to correct for any offsets from the astrom

          solutions found in the asTrans files.

          The image itself has had the FLOATCOMPRESS algorithm

          (see the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/software/idlutils/">idlutils</a>
          package)

          applied to it, keeping 10 significant binary digits. This approach guarantees
          that the

          precision is kept strictly within 0.1 percent per pixel, and allows a very
          efficient

          compression using bzip2. No special scaling or adjustment need be

          applied to the values when read in.'

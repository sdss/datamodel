          form.
          A superflat is a bspline average across all fibers of the flat spectrum
          in raw counts as a function of wavelength. The various column name are explained
          in the b-spline routine in $IDLUTILS/pro/bspline.

          profile width for each fiber bundle. This Gaussian sigma is in units of
          pixels.
          The X-positions on the CCD and their corresponding profile width are fitted
          to a functional form and the resulting coefficients are stored in a binary
          table.
          The X-position is the independent variable and the width is the dependent
          variable for the fitting function.

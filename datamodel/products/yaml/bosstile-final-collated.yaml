  description: "The combined list of targets from all\nchunks[*] after they have been\
    \ passed through the tiling code. This\nfile thus indicates which targets were\
    \ assigned fibers and which\ntargets did not due to fiber collisions. This file\
    \ is not the same as\na concatentation of the final-bossN files from each chunk,\
    \ because\nsections of many chunks have been \"retiled\", or newer chunks have\n\
    overlapped older chunks and assigned fibers to targets that were\noriginally collided.\
    \ <br/> This file also contains the most up-to-date version of the target\nselection\
    \ flags so that a uniform sample of LRGs can be easily drawn\nfrom the file. <br/>\
    \ [*] - As per the name of the file, this file only contains targets\nfrom boss2\
    \ through bossN. Boss1, the commissioning chunk, was\nsuperceded by boss11. Chunks\
    \ with numbers above 100 are for special\nplates that do not necessarily target\
    \ LRGs.  The file \nbosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss32.fits is the parent target\
    \ catalog for \nDR10 and DR11 LSS catalogs.  bosstile-final-collated-boss2-boss38.fits\
    \ is \nthe parent catalog for DR12."

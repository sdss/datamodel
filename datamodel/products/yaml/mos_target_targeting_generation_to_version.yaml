  short: 'MOS Target table: mos_target_targeting_generation_to_version'
  description: A 'targeting_generation' describes a collection of versioned cartons,
    together with their robostrategy control parameters. This is a convenient way
    to describe the specific set of carton-versions that were used (and the way that
    they were treated) within any particular run of robostrategy.  The dr19_targeting_generation_to_version
    table describes a one-to-many relationship, connecting each robostrategy run to
    one targeting_generation. In general, a single target_generation can be used my
    more than one robostrategy run.  Taken together, the dr19_targeting_generation,
    dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton and dr19_targeting_generation_to_version tables
    duplicate, in a database form, the robostrategy carton configuration information
    available via the rsconfig product (https://github.com/sdss/rsconfig).

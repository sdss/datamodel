  description: 'This file contains line indices calculated

    from local continuum and global continuum by the SEGUE

    Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP). The global continuum is obtained from

    fitting a polynomial function to an entire spectrum, while, the local continuum
    is determined

    from a linear fit between blue and red side of the central line band to measure

    its line index. The error measurement in each line index and quality check on
    each line index measured

    are also included. Note that the line indices for TiO5, TiO8, CaH1, CaH2, and
    CaH3 are calculated following

    the prescription given by the Hammer program (Covey et al. 2007). UVCN and BLCN
    line indices are computed

    by he equations given in Smith & Norris (1982), and FeI_4 and FeI_5 indices by
    the recipe in Friel (1987).

    FeI_1, FeI_2, FeI_3, and SrII line indices are only computed from the local continuum.

    Thus, these line indices calculated from different methods report the same values
    for both the local continuum and

    the global continuum.'

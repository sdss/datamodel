  description: 'Line measurements for fibers for

    which the MPA-JHU spectroscopic parameters pipeline has been run.

    This file is built out of a similar one in the galspec SVN product. It

    is designed to be line-by-line matched with

    the <a href="specObj.html"> specObj</a> list of all spectra.  Any

    spectra in specObj that do not have a measurement from the MPA-JHU

    pipeline have all values zeroed out in this file.  There is further

    information about the MPA-JHU results in the parallel

    files <a href="galSpecInfo.html">

    galSpecInfo</a> , <a href="galSpecIndx.html"> galSpecIndx</a> ,

    and <a href="galSpecExtra.html"> galSpecExtra</a> . ID values

    in <a href="galSpecInfo.html"> galSpecInfo</a> are set to -1 for cases

    where there were no results from the MPA-JHU pipeline. In some cases,

    the pipeline was run but we don''t believe the results are reliable, in

    which case the column "RELIABLE"

    in <a href="galSpecInfo.html">galSpecInfo</a> is set to zero.'

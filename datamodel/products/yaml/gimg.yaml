  description: 'The gimg files are produced by the 2.5m Sloan Telescope guider camera.
    This file

    is processed by the guider actor to produce <a href="proc-gimg.html">proc-

    gimg</a> files, and to actually perform the guiding of the telescope. These are

    16-bit FITS images, as read out of the Apogee Alta F47 guide CCD. Flat frames

    are full readout (1024x1024 pixels), while dark and data frames are 2x2 binned

    (512x512 pixels), each with their respective overscan region (24 or 12 pixels)

    on one axis. Depending on guide star brightness, the observers may take the

    guide images in "stack" mode, which median combines the requested number of

    exposures to improve dynamic range. Stacked images are also used for start-of-

    night darks. See the STACK and EXPTIMEN keywords for more details.'

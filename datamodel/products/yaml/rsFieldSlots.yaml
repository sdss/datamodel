  name: rsFieldSlots
  short: Needed and available slots for field-cadence combination.
  description: For every field-cadence combination in rsOptions, this file has whether
    each LST and sky brightness slot is available for the field, and what number of
    exposures is needed total for the cadence. LST is broken up into 24 hour-long
    slots, covering 0-1h, 1-2h, etc. Sky brightness is broken up into dark and bright
    in that order, based on a maximum illumination of 0.35 for dark time. The LST
    allowed depends on the airmass; the airmass must be less than 1.4 or less than
    the minimum possible airmass for the field plus 0.2. Note that this criterion
    does not account for the detailed obsmode information for each exposure. The file
    is created by the robostrategy script rs_field_slots. The information is used
    in rs_allocate when the cadence choices are made.

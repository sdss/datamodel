  short: 'MOS Target table: mos_target_sdss_id_flat'
  description: 'This table includes associations between sdss_id identifiers and the
    best matched catalogid for each catalogue cross-match. Unlike dr19_sdss_id_stacked,
    this table contains multiple rows per sdss_id, one for each cross-match association.
    When multiple sdss_ids are associated with the same catalogid, the one with the
    lowest rank (rank=1) should be preferred. Note: The sdss_id match was extended
    internally for a more recent crossmatch not yet part of the publicly released
    data. As such, the ra/dec_sdss_id columns may differ from the catalogid coordinates.'

          t1,t2,t3 are eigen values of the tidal tensor along the major, intermediate
          and minor axes at the position of the galaxy. By definition t1>t2>t3. The
          eigenvalues can be used to classify the large scale environment (Hahn et
          al. 2007).

          * If T1>0,T2>0,T3>0, then the galaxies are in cluster environment.

          * If T1>0,T2>0,T3<0, filament environment.

          * If T1>0,T2<0,T3<0, sheet environment.

          * If T1<0,T2<0,T3<0, void environment.

          x_major, y_major, z_major show the 3-d direction of the major axis of the
          eigenvector of the tidal tensor. x_minor, y_minor, z_minor show the 3-d
          direction of the minor axis of the eigenvector of the tidal tensor. Where

          * x_major^2+y_major^2+z_major^2=1

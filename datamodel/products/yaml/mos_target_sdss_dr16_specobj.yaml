  description: 'This is a base table containing ALL the spectroscopic information,
    including a lot of duplicate and bad data. Use the SpecObj view instead, which
    has the data properly filtered for cleanliness. These tables contain both the
    BOSS and SDSS spectrograph data. NOTE: The RA and Dec in this table refer to the
    DR8 coordinates, which have errors in the region north of 41 deg in Dec. This
    change does not affect the matching to the photometric catalog.'

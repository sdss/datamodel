    replace me - This file is the template data model file. It is meant as a guideline
    to how to write each data model file.  The main categories (in bold)
    should be respected, but extra information can be included as
    appropriate.  The example sections below are primarily related to FITS files.
  release: {{release}}
  datatype: {{filetype}}
  naming_convention: >
    replace me - {{ filename }}, Replace this filename with a
    regular expression that matches the file name.  For example, a six-digit number would
    correspond to `[0-9]{6}`.  `template-123456.fits`
    would be `template-[0-9]{6}\.fits`
  generated_by: >
    replace me - with the name(s) of any git or svn product(s) that produces this product.
